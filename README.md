# QueueTea

A simple command line interface for connecting to 3D printers via the Construct Protocol.


Note: QueueTea requires a Construct Server to connect to and print with. In other words, you're going to need [Pronserve](https://github.com/D1plo1d/Printrun/tree/pronserve) installed on your printer.


## Developers

Suffice to say, here be dragons.


Good luck and happy printing.
